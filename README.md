# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a simple simulation game of Rock Paper Scissors in a grid format. Each cell can either be a rock, paper, scissors or empty and each turn they move one space in a cardinal direction. If an object encounter an non-empty cell, they will 'fight' as per RPS rules (rock > scissors > paper > rock) and the winner occupies the new space. My intention is to create several algorithms to determine how each object moves (e.g. randomly, nearest winning fight etc...) as well as other various toggles that modify the behaviour.
